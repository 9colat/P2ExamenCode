# P2ExamenCode
In here there is multible codes, and the raw data pulled from the testing.

The Curve.script is the final script used by the robot to do the welding between the front shrout and the vanes.

The Curve.txt is the curves data points exported by roboDK.

The ForwardsKinematicsSOLUTION.m is a matlab script that gives the forwards kinematics solution, as the name implise.

The InverseKinematicsSOLUTION.m is a matlab script that gives the inverse kinematics solution, as the name implise.

The JacobianPointGrid.m is the matlab script that have given the joint configuration that are singularitets.

The PlotTest.m is the script that takes the data from both RoboDK and the the UR5 and compaire then graficly.

The hub.script is the final script used by the robot to do the welding between the rear shrout and the central hub.

The Log_history_1.txt is the data point gained from the UR5 during testing.

The raw_data.txt is something

The rear.script is the final script used by the robot to do the welding between the rear shrout and the already welded parts.

the testdata.txt is the joint configuration that have a determinant of zero, and therefore is a singularity.
